# Daily Coding Problem 2019-07-19

####  _ Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Facebook._

_Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded._

_For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'._

_You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed._

* _Note: problem has been completed in javascript._
